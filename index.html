      In June 2019, I graduated from International School in Bellevue, Washington. In September, I will be
      heading off to Northwestern University in Evanston, IL intending to study Environmental Engineering.
      I hope to also double major with a degree in Manufacturing and Design Engineering. Some of my passions
      include engineering, physics, math, computer science, and music.
