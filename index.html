  <h1> My Senior Project </h1>
  <p> For my senior project, I initially wanted to fully design and 3D Print a
  mini piano. However, after talking with my mentors, I realized that idea was
  unfeasible. Instead, I decided to import a design for a 3D Printed recorder
  and modify the design so that the recorder sounded like a handmade version.
