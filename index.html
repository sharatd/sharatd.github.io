      In June 2019, I graduated from International School in Bellevue, Washington. In September, I will be
      heading off to Northwestern University in Evanston, IL intending to study Environmental Engineering. I hope to also
      double major with a degree in Applied Math. Some of my passions include engineering, physics, math, computer science,
      and music.
