      In June 2019, I graduated from International School in Bellevue, Washington. In September, I will be
      heading off to Northwestern University in Evanston, IL intending to study Environmental Engineering.
      I hope to also double major with a degree in Manufacturing and Design Engineering. Some of my passions
      include engineering, physics, math, computer science, and music.

      Here's a link to a video of me playing Bach's Prelude and Fugue on Piano:

    <p>
      Using 3-D printing and design technology along with biodegradable filament available at the Library,
      I created a <a href = "https://www.yamaha.com/en/musical_instrument_guide/recorder/structure/" id = "links"> recorder </a> and an
      <a href = <"https://www.stlocarina.com/ocarina-history.html" id = "links"> ocarina </a>. To fulfill my objective, I worked with the
      International School Tech Team and Bellevue Libraryâ€™s Makerspace staff to receive help in designing and creating the instruments. By the end of the project,
      the instruments produced clear tones that could be connected to form melodies and tunes.
      Finally, as proof that I achieved my project goal, I played the instruments and presented them at the Bellevue Library Makerspace.
